// Package authgate holds framework-agnostic building blocks shared by every deepwork auth gate
// (the standalone terminal's net/http authWrap, the standalone teamworkbench gin gate, and
// deepwork-pro's gin middleware). It deliberately knows nothing about HTTP, gin, IPs or cookies —
// it is pure policy, so a single implementation serves every call site with no duplication (the
// SSOT for auth-code generation, canonicalization, comparison, and failure throttling).

// Throttle is a process-wide (GLOBAL, not per-IP) brake on FAILED auth attempts.
//
// Why global, not per-IP: the auto-generated auth code is short + human-friendly (~39-bit), and a
// public cloudflare tunnel reaches the server over loopback (cloudflared → 127.0.0.1), collapsing
// every visitor to one source address. Per-IP limiting is therefore both useless (all traffic looks
// identical) and forgeable (X-Forwarded-For is attacker-controlled), so only a single shared failure
// budget actually bounds a network brute-force.
//
// Two invariants, both intentional:
//   - Only FAILED attempts are charged. A correct code is NEVER delayed — call Reset on success and
//     Penalty only on a failed compare. Honest logins stay instant even while a flood is in flight.
//   - It never hard-locks. It adds increasing delay (and the caller surfaces Retry-After); it never
//     refuses a correct code. A legitimate user is at worst slowed if THEY mistype — never locked out
//     by someone else's guessing.
//
// The failure score decays exponentially, so a few human typos cost nothing (they sit under the free
// burst and evaporate during the quiet that follows) while a sustained guessing flood is throttled to
// an infeasible steady-state rate.
